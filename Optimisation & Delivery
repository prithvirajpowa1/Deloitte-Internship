Task 1
*****Define the project approach*****
Conduct an initial market scan to evaluate and select a new financial accounting system.

Here is the background information on your task
SectorMetric has been steadily growing its presence in Australia and New Zealand over the last few years. SectorMetric went public earlier this year with the ASX listing, providing increased opportunities for further growth. As a result, its existing financial accounting solution in its current form will not meet SectorMetric’s growing future needs.

The finance team is looking to upgrade the existing Accounting software with an integrated cloud based financial system. SectorMetric have therefore engaged Deloitte to guide them through the technology evaluation and selection process.

Here is your task
SectorMetric has asked Deloitte to advise and guide them through the market scan, evaluation and selection process for a new financial accounting system for the organisation. 

With a clear understanding of the scope and timelines (outlined above) you will need to complete an assessment of the Financial Accounting Software available.

Please provide us with a project plan that covers the following items and elaborate what each item will contain. We want to make sure that we present a strong approach to our client so that they are confident that we are able to leverage our previous experience within the technology evaluation and selection space.

Your plan should be summarised into a 2-3 slide Powerpoint deck covering the following:

Understanding of scope
Understanding of requirements
Initial draft timelines
Initial resource plan
Estimation of fees
Risks / issues / dependencies.
To help you get started, we have provided some useful information on leading market providers for Cloud Financial Close Solutions from the Gartner Magic Quadrant for financial accounting systems.

Task 2
*****Conduct a market scan*****
Evaluate the market to understand what potential solutions are available to meet SectorMetric’s requirements.
Here is the background information on your task
We have successfully presented our project plan and approach to our clients in SectorMetric with positive feedback received. We are now up to the project phase.

Market scans for technological solutions are usually conducted through a combination of desktop research and talking to the owner of the solution. Technological solutions are matched against “best-fit” criteria, then further matched against client capabilities.


Here is your task
Now that you have a clear understanding of SectorMetric’s requirements (outlined in Task 1), conduct a market scan to understand the potential solutions available.

From this you should be able to:

Compile a list of technology solutions and include rationale (why they were considered/ what can they provide)
Use the detailed capability assessment provided and define a list of potential technological solutions (potentially 2-3 solutions that come closest to meeting the client’s requirements).
Provide the client with a status update, illustrating the above findings within 2-3 slides. Don't forget to outline the next steps that they should take.

Task 3
*****Further analysis & solution presentation*****
Conduct further analysis on the selected vendors, summarise your findings and present your proposed solution.
Here is the background information on your task
We are up to the final phase of our engagement with SectorMetric. This is where we present SectorMetric with our research on technological solutions and their appropriate providers. We must also conduct an initial feasibility assessment and a high-level implementation plan for integrating the technology solution.

Here is your task
Conduct further analysis on the selected technology solution provider and their service offering through a Request for Proposal (RFP).

You will need to:

Read through the RFP sample provided and create an evaluation matrix template to help you easily capture the responses. Note that you won’t have to reach out to the solution providers but have a think of what their responses would be. Make sure to keep it brief.
Using the prepopulated evaluation matrix, determine the most appropriate and feasible option, and present your findings to SectorMetric. Don’t forget to demonstrate and justify how you came to your proposed solution. Make sure you highlight the key attributes including cost and comparison between the client criteria and technology service scope.
Include a high-level implementation plan on how you will implement the most suitable solution.
